# _localhost
My first tentative attempt at creating a local website and a blog from scratch using HTML, CSS, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, 
Php perhaps...
I'm also wanting to explore other languages and libraries/modules a bit further down the track.

Prep:
Have got some files good to go, but having problems with some pages.

Form:
I'm going for the lean, minimilist look to begin with, then I'll start experimenting with different look and feel templates.

Functionality:
I'm wanting it to have a fluid, robust layout thats consistent with all screen sizes.
I'm having problems with Jquery email forms within a div. I'm wanting to send the email form contents while redirecting to another page within that same div, then a timed redirect back to the Home page.
